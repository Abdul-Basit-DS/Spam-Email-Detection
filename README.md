# Spam-Email-Detection
# 📧 Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This is a **Spam Detection System** built using **Machine Learning and Flask**. It classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model is trained using the **TF-IDF vectorizer** and a **Naïve Bayes classifier**. The web interface is designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it interactive and user-friendly.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Detects spam messages with high accuracy**
- 📊 **Machine Learning model trained using TF-IDF & Naïve Bayes**
- 🌐 **Flask-based web app for real-time message classification**
- 🎨 **Simple and clean user interface (HTML, CSS, JS)**
- 🔄 **Interactive and fast response time**
- 🏗️ **Easily deployable on any server**
